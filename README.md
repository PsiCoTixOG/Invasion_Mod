UPDATE 03/18/2014
-----------------
Started to comment the heck out of the main class; I plan on doing the same thing to all the files.. mostly
also added a list of the classes I can confirm are good to go

UPDATE 03/03/2014
-----------------
Way better source base; lets see what needs to be changed now??

UPDATE 02/16/2014
----------------

Currrently this code is a little messed up; it was decomplied using 1.6.4 instead of 1.6.2: due to the massive background changes in these two versions.. we end up with a fair amount of incorrectly named methods etc

attempting to get a proper 1.6.2 dev setup has been... trouble to say the least.
