Original source for Invasion Mod v0.12.0b
Built with Forge 9.10.0, FML (19/08/2013)

updating to MC 1.6.4 as it appears the original developer has ceased developement

Mapping Notes:
ColorizeGrass = World
CallableItemName = EntityPlayer
import net.minecraft.src.nm = import net.minecraft.entity.Entity;
derp?? = import net.minecraft.world.World;
bcr = ModelRenderer 

T = ?? WTF

EnumToolMeterial = ItemStack (I'm rather confident)

Notes:
NOOB HAUS - PsiCoTix
looks like this was originally developed for ModLoader; meaning there is plenty of work needed to be done.

Item Notes:
  Genreal
Items are all extendeds of ItemHoe; I feel like this requires a switch to Item;


Entity Notes:
  Genreal:
Mods where registered previously with a "Global" ID, not a Mod level ID; this needs to be changed.
Entity Mobs implement ICanDig, this seems to be a cause of issue for the Entityreg; will need to look thru ICanDig see if it can be implemented via a diffrent means

lots of entities are usinf dragon ??
